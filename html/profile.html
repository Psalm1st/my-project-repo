				<h3>Introduction</h3>
				My name is Samuel Chukwu; also known as Amicable. I am <b>Aquarius</b> by Zodiac; born on the
				30th of January in the South-eastern part of Nigeria. I am actually the last fruit of my parents.
				I recently moved to the Netherlands to further my education and I live in Middelburg, Zeeland.
				The idea had always been to study somewhere outside my comfort zone, which poised my choice to study
				here at <b>HZ University of Applied Science</b> as an ideal destination to build my lifelong career.
				<h3>Hobbies</h3>
				I really love to play soccer. I am an avid football fan and supporter of Manchester United FC. When I
				was little, due to the great love I had for playing, I joined a community club, where I played as left
				back.
				I grew up with the same passion for the game. As a matter of fact, I was awarded the Best football
				Player back in Secondary School, for 2015/2016 Academic Year, after I led my RedHouse team to victory,
				during our annual inter-house Sport game.<br>
				<br>I am also a great fan of music. Often times, I listen to
				music when I have pile of works to do around the house. It actually makes work less tedious. Having
				music around, I can work like a robot. I am always fond of playing with kids. My niblings drive a
				lot of joy to hear I am coming to visit them or when they get invitations to come by. They love to
				have me around; where we would play all day, as well as watch cartoons together. They made me love
				anime and some other cartoons too.<br><br>
				I really love nature and outdoor activities as well, like sight-seeing and going to the beach.
				I also like dangerous stuff that will give me a trill; for example, I want to go parachute diving
				or bungy jumping someday.
				</p>
				<h3>Personality</h3>
				If I were to describe myself in five words, I would say:
				<ul class="characteristics-profile">
					<li>Gentle</li>
					<li>Straight-forward</li>
					<li>Hardworking</li>
					<li>Creative</li>
					<li>Tolerant</li>
				</ul>
