				<h2>My motivation for ICT</h2>
				<p> My innate interest while growing up has been to broaden my knowledge on the use of computers and its
					application to facilitate scientific research in solving professional and social issues. I have been
					influenced by the ICT course and the channel of specialization it offers, which focuses on the most
					intriguing aspect of Programming, Software designs, Business intelligence, Web development and so
					on.<br><br>
					I have always given thought to how each and everyone would benefit me in the future, hence, why I
					would
					love to take my education to a higher level, with an opportunity to enhance my current understanding
					through studying at one of the prestigious destinations. With utmost confidence, I believe that
					spending most of my time studying my dream IT course here, would not only enable me to receive
					an exceptional training in the field, but allow me gain new perspectives into professionalism and be
					part
					of the vital instruments for my nation.

				<h2>Why I find ICT suitable</h2>
				<p> The ICT programme fits me because, in the ICT field you get a lot of freedom when working on
					projects.
					My future career goal has always been to become a Software Developer with great knowledge on IT
					field, generally;
					and be part of the essential marshals that leverage modern tools, as well as adopt best practices to
					lead
					businesses in complex and uncertain environments. I would also love to broaden my horizon to acquire
					more
					knowledge and expertise in terms of breadth and depth, in order to avail myself the opportunity to
					work around
					experts, which will further open door for me to develop a salient skill required to optimize the
					effectiveness
					of ICT in a wider range of application that cuts across Robotics, Data Analytics and
					Cyber-information security.<br><br>

					I have always envisaged to be part of the essential instrument that will help bridge the digital
					divide; help
					those who often lag behind, assist local businesses scale up to a global level and create more
					employable
					computer experts that will meet the standards of the modern world. Moreover, I will continue to
					apply the
					same diligence I must have acquired, into making service to others my top priority and contribute to
					the
					basic aim of making the world a global village.
