				<h2>Study choice</h2>
				<p> Having developed a keen eye for the emerging technologies around me, I have always been
					passionate about exploring the science of computers and information system ever since I was a kid.
					My innate interest around Computer exploration began from an early age, as I usually formed
					the habit of fondling with some of the gadgets around; ostensibly trying to explore the
					mechanism behind their functionalities.
					My knowledgeable experiences while growing up; summer computer lessons and computer
					studies in my previous schools, equipped me with the opportunity to enhance my technical
					skill a little, and be<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> able to dexterously manage
						different tasks and responsibilities around my sphere.
						<br><br>
						I am a bit of a curious one and like to know how some stuff work. I think this kind of
						study and work will give me the opportunity to discover and adjust these things. Since the demand
						for IT professionals are high at workplaces, it motivates me more to keep learning new things;
						thus,keep my interest wide and keep developing.
						<br><br>
						I want to find a job and maybe go abroad to do so, I hope during my internship to get an image
						of the jobs and maybe even get a job over, hence I pick interest in software engineering - it means
						I will be creating lots of things plus I like to create. I expect to at least learn the basics
						of computers, engineering, coding and how a lot of existing programs work, altogether.</span></p>

				<h2>Personal SWOT analysis</h2>
				<p><b>STRENGTH:</b>
					<br>
					Strong at heart and eager to learn new things. Very much interested in team
					work and accept people regardless of their background.
					<br><br>
					<b>WEAKNESS:</b>
					<br>
					Struggle with low self-esteem. Always afraid of letting
					another down and/or making mistakes. Sometimes keen to lay down for another.
					<br><br>
					<b>OPPORTUNITY:</b>
					<br>
					I believe engaging with various people around me will not only help grow my social circle
					and build my communication skill, but will create opportunity to learn from each other.
					Moreover, soccer game is one ideal place where I usually express myself freely; thus, make
					friends of like minds easily and create room for fun.
					<br><br>
					<b>THREAT:</b>
					<br>
					Sometimes being too isolated makes it difficult to decipher when am going through
					hard times. I just do not feel like sharing a personal burden with another; instead
					bear it alone.</span>

				<h2>Programming experience</h2>
				<p> I do not have any prior programming experience. But so far, I have tried to gain
					some knowledge about the entire thing, coming to realise with the few time I have to just look
					through, I think I am gradually getting to understand the concept of what it is all about.<br><br>
					However, I am just eager to learn and master it, in the best way possible; hence why am here.

				<h2>First feedback</h2>
				<p>This is a small summary of the first feedback I got from my pitch. These are some of the main points.
					<br><br>
					Compliments
				<ul>
					<li>My code looks organized.</li>
					<li>It has a nice look and feel to it.</li>
					<li>(they did not say too much which also gives the feeling of not doing much wrong.)</li>
				</ul>
				Improvements
				<ul>
					<li>Using absolute positioning instead of other ways (fallacy, I do not really
						understand how to work with the positioning)</li>
					<li>Need to combine more CSS (carelessness, prioritizing other things in the site)</li>
					<li>Incomplete FAQ answers as expected (fallacy, n/a - corrections applied already)</li>
				</ul>
				Code review Feedback
				<ul>
					<li>Absolute positioning was actually a solution but I guess that came back as feedback from the
						pitch to not use anymore.</li>
					<li>Making a stylesheet which I did expect there is room for improvement and was mentioned in the
						pitch feedback also.</li>
					<li>Cleaning up the look of my site which I did and there was no feedback about this in the pitch
						feedback.</li>
				</ul>
				Tasks
				<ul>
					<li>Find a way to fix the absolute positioning while keeping the look the same -fix the stylesheet
						and make my CSS simpler.</li>
					<li>fix small mistakes like FAQ answers.</li>
					<li>make my site more reactive.</li>
				</ul>
